            <p><strong>SDG 15</strong> is about protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity. In Victoria, feral cats kill millions of native animals each year.</p>
            <p>This includes threatened species like the Malleefowl, Eastern Bettong, and Spot-tailed Quoll â€” many of which are already on the edge of extinction.</p>
            <p>You can support SDG-15 by reporting sightings, encouraging responsible pet ownership, and spreading awareness.</p>

        distribution: "The bettong lives in eastern Tasmania on islands like Maria and Bruny. It once lived on mainland Australia, including Victoria, but disappeared because of feral cats. Bettongs are small, nocturnal animals, making them easy targets for cats, which are skilled night hunters.

Its fur is a rich red to dark brown, covered with white spots that continue along its tail, making it easy to tell apart from other Australian animals. Males weigh around 3.5 kilograms, while females are about 2 kilograms",
        distribution: "The Spot-tailed Quoll lives along the Great Dividing Range, from Victoria to Queensland, in forests, woodlands, and rocky areas. In Victoria, it is endangered, with strongholds in East Gippsland and the Upper Snowy River.

        distribution: "The Black-eared Miner is found in Victoria's mallee woodlands, mainly in the Murray-Sunset, Hattah-Kulkyne, and Wyperfeld National Parks. It is listed as critically endangered and feral cats as major threats. Feral cats hunt adult birds and chicks, and as mallee habitats shrink, the birds have fewer safe places to nest and feed.",

Both males and females have greyish-black bills and brown eyes, but males are brighter, with grass-green feathers, bright yellow underparts, and a vivid orange belly patch. Males also have a deep blue band between the eyes and bright blue on the wings, while females are duller with less blue and a smaller orange patch.",
        distribution: "The critically endangered Orange-bellied Parrot, a small migratory parrot, breeds in Tasmania and migrates to coastal Victoria and South Australia for winter, relying on saltmarsh habitat for survival.

It has a pointed snout, large ears, and a short tail. This bandicoot is mostly active at night, using its strong claws to dig for insects and plant roots. During the day, it hides in nests made of grass and leaves to stay safe from predators.",
        distribution: "Eastern Barred Bandicoots were once widespread across the grasslands and grassy woodlands of western Victoria, extending into south-eastern South Australia.

Its thick brown fur is reddish on the rump and grey on the shoulders, with paler fur on the chest and belly. Some have a white blaze on their chest, along with a white stripe on the cheek and a black line from the forehead to the neck. Highly agile, this wallaby moves easily over rocky ground, using its strong build, flexible tail for balance, and rough-textured feet for grip. Males weigh about 8 kg and females around 6 kg.",
        distribution: "In Victoria, the Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby survives in only two small, isolated locations, with fewer than 60 animals left in the wild. This agile species lives in rugged, rocky areas, hiding among ridges during the day and feeding on grasses at dusk. Feral cats are a major threat, preying on young wallabies and adding pressure to the already fragile population.",

It has a brown, scaly tail that is about the same length as its body. The mouse has big eyes with a pale orange ring around them, and its underparts are greyish-white. Both males and females are similar in size, weighing between 11 and 35 grams.",
        distribution: "In Victoria, the Desert Mouse once lived in sandy deserts and dry woodland areas of the northwest. It is now extinct in the state, with feral cats contributing to its decline by preying on these small, ground-dwelling rodents.

Its body is warm brown above and pale underneath, with soft streaking. Males have a bright orange-brown body and a blue throat and eyebrow stripe. Females are plainer, without the blue markings. Despite their small size, they move quickly through dense mallee shrubs.",

Its head and neck are buff-grey, and its body is a mix of brown, black, and white, helping it blend into the environment. With sharp hearing and eyesight, the Malleefowl can sense danger early and usually sneaks away, relying on its camouflage. Though it can fly well, it prefers to run quickly when startled.",

They live in south-eastern Australia, often found in and around swamps and wetlands. At night, they move between wet areas in search of food. These frogs are patient predators, feeding on insects, small lizards, fish, tadpoles, and even other frogs.",
        distribution: "In Victoria, the Growling Grass Frog is listed as vulnerable and lives in wetlands, swamps, and lagoons across the state.
